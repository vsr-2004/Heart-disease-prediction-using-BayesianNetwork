Introduction
Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early and accurate detection is paramount for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a predictive model for heart disease using a Bayesian Network, a powerful probabilistic graphical model capable of representing and reasoning under uncertainty. By leveraging conditional probabilities between various risk factors and symptoms, the model can provide insights into a patient's likelihood of having heart disease.

Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for building, training, and evaluating a Bayesian Network model for heart disease prediction. The project focuses on learning the structure and parameters of the network from clinical data and then using it for inference on new patient profiles.

Features
Bayesian Network Construction: Programmatically constructs the Bayesian Network structure.
Parameter Learning: Learns the Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) from training data.
Inference: Performs probabilistic inference to predict the likelihood of heart disease given a set of symptoms/risk factors.
Data Preprocessing: Includes scripts for cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw medical data.
Evaluation Metrics: Assesses model performance using standard metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Visualization (Optional/Future): Potentially visualizes the network structure for better understanding.
Methodology
The core methodology involves:

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Obtaining and cleaning a relevant heart disease dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Selection/Engineering: Identifying and potentially transforming relevant features (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type).
Bayesian Network Structure Learning: Employing algorithms (e.g., K2, Hill Climb, Chow-Liu) to infer the relationships (edges) between variables in the network.
Parameter Learning: Calculating the Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) for each node based on the training data, given the learned structure.
Inference: Using the trained Bayesian Network to calculate the posterior probability of heart disease given new evidence (patient symptoms).
Model Evaluation: Testing the model's predictive performance on unseen data.
Dataset
Name: [Specify your dataset name, e.g., "Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset," "UCI Heart Disease Dataset"]
Source: [Provide a link to the dataset, e.g., https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease]
Description: [Briefly describe the dataset - e.g., "Contains 303 instances with 76 attributes, though typically only 14 are used, covering patient demographics, symptoms, and diagnostic results."]
Location in Project: data/heart_disease.csv (or specify your actual path)
Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-detection-bayesian-network.git
cd heart-detection-bayesian-network
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

Bash

python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
Install required Python packages:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Create a requirements.txt file by running pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, pgmpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.)

Example requirements.txt content:

pandas>=1.0.0
numpy>=1.18.0
pgmpy>=0.1.13 # Or the specific version you used
scikit-learn>=0.24.0
matplotlib>=3.3.0
seaborn>=0.11.0
Usage
1. Data Preparation
Ensure your dataset is placed in the data/ directory as specified in the Dataset section.

2. Run the Main Script
Execute the main script to build, train, and evaluate the model:

Bash

python main.py
(Replace main.py with the name of your primary script if it's different, e.g., src/model_trainer.py)

3. Making Predictions (Inference)
You can use the trained model for inference.
Example of how to query the network (assuming you have a function or script for inference):

Python

# This is a conceptual example, actual implementation will vary
from src.inference_module import predict_heart_disease

# Example patient data (replace with actual patient inputs)
patient_symptoms = {
    'chest_pain_type': 'typical angina',
    'cholesterol': 'high',
    'exercise_induced_angina': 'yes',
    'age': 'middle'
}

likelihood = predict_heart_disease(patient_symptoms)
print(f"Likelihood of heart disease: {likelihood:.2f}")
Refer to the comments within the code files for more detailed instructions on specific functions and classes.
